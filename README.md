# Layers

Layers should be 500kb max
All GeoJSON FeatureCollections


Forest change monitoring via satellite is also valuable


Where is the old growth?
Where is the protected old growth? (Who owns the forest?)
Where is the unprotected old growth? (Who owns the forest?)
Where is the historically logged old growth?
Where is the planned logged old growth?


Old Growth on Private land is highest risk.
Where is the planned private deforestation?


Summary of layers:

Important
- [] At Risk layer (intersection Old growth from GNN that overlaps with Private Land (non-protected))
- [] Old growth layer
- [x] Oregon state boundary

Less important

- [] Land ownership layer
- [x] All Forest Loss layer (GFW) by all causes historically
- [x] Historic/planned timber harvests on USFS land in Oregon
